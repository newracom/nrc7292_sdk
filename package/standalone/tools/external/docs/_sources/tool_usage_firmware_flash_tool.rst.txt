Tool Usage (Firmware Flash Tool)
================================

Overview
--------
*Firmware Flash Tool* is a GUI utility for executing flash-related operations (e.g. reading/writing MAC addresses, flashing XIP standalone bootloader/firmware, identifying flash information, updating flash partitioning profile) on NRC7292/NRC7394 modules.

Tool Version
------------

* v6.4 (Default: FirmwareFlashTool.exe)

* v7.4 (Multi Upload: MultiFirmwareFlashTool.exe)

Binary Files
------------

.. warning::
   Make sure that the correct 2nd bootloader, XIP bootloader and XIP firmware binaries corresponding to the module types (NRC7292 or NRC7394) are selected!

**2nd Bootloader**:

    * The 2nd bootloader binary file to be temporarily written on RAM to replace the mask ROM bootloader to augment the bootloader functionalities for the tool operation.

**XIP Bootloader**:

    * The XIP bootloader binary file to be stored on the flash memory. If the non-default 5s-wait XIP bootloader is uploaded on the module, the bootloader will wait for 5 seconds to handle firmware upload requests from the tool before jumping to the XIP firmware following a reset. This can be useful during the initial development phase for achieving a quick upload-test-debug cycle.

**XIP Firmware**:

    * The XIP firmware binary file to be stored on the flash memory.

**Auto-reset**:

    * An optional feature that triggers the bootloader to execute the uploaded XIP firmware following the upload procedure. This option is only valid with the non-default 5s-wait XIP bootloader operating in the standalone operation mode.

**Clear NVS Sector**:

    * Clears the NVS sector on the flash memory if selected.

**Flash Memory Map (NRC7394/2MB Only)**:

    * Flash partitioning profiles to be written. (Default: 1)

    * Profile: (F/W / FOTA / User Data) [KBytes]

        * 1: (968 / 968 / 8)

        * 2: (972 / 972 / 0)

        * 3: (1936 / 0 / 8)

        * 4: (1944 / 0 / 0)

Operation
---------

1. Set the DIP switch (for NRC7292) or jumper configuration (for NRC7394) to **Download** mode.

2. Select the desired procedures by using the GUI interface (e.g. MAC adresss write, XIP bootloader write, and XIP firmware write).

3. Reset the board, and press the **START** button to execute the selected procedures.

Multi Firmware Flash Tool
-------------------------

*Multi Firmware Flash Tool* is a variant of the *Firmware Flash Tool* that allows concurrent uploads.
