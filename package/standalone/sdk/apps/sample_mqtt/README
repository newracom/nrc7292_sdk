Sample MQTT utilize TLS connection as default. A user can undefine or comment out the line "#define USE_MQTTS" to use plain TCP connection.

Preparation.

-- Certificate preparation.
sample_mqtt utilized generate-CA.sh (originated from https://github.com/owntracks/tools/raw/master/TLS/generate-CA.sh) to generate self signed certificates.

CA certificate is located as certs/ca.crt and imported into sample_mqtt.c as const char ca_cert[].
Sample client certificate is located as certs/sample_mqtt.crt and imported into sample_mqtt.c as const char client_cert[].
Sample client private key is located as certs/sample_mqtt.key and imported into sample_mqtt.c as const char client_pk[].

-- Broker configuration.
To simplify the test, use mosquitto on the broker.

On Ubuntu system
1. sudo apt-get install mosquitto
2. copy certs/ca.crt to /etc/mosquitto/ca_certificates/
3. copy certs/broker.crt to /etc/mosquitto/certs/
4. copy certs/mosquitto-tls.conf to /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/
5. restart mosquitto by "sudo systemctl restart mosquitto"

-- Once the broker is ready, then build sample_mqtt and update the firmware.
